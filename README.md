INTERIOR HEALTH SERVICES
The Interior Health app is a brainschild of developers who saw the need to offer a solution to the looming crisis of affordable health in marginalised communities in Interior Kenya. We aim to provide affordable drugs and health care services to such individuals while working closely with the local health patronage in selling these drugs/services to the local communities. This project is also key in our graduation from the full stack software engineering program at aLX.
