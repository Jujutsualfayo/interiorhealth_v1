INTERIOR HEALTH SERVICES
The Interior Health app is a brainschild of developers who saw the need to offer a solution to the looming crisis of affordable health in marginalised communities in Interior Kenya. We aim to provide affordable drugs and health care services to such individuals while working closely with the local health patronage in selling these drugs/services to the local communities. This project is also key in our graduation from the full stack software engineering program at aLX.

             providing affordable health care to the most vulnerable people in interior Kenya
Description
The interior app is a pharmaceutical web application for selling over the counter drugs.

We come from a Country that is well and trully marred with a poor health care system. And we thought, let's create something that will help sort this issue out and while at it get ourselves to graduate.

Why Interior Health?
Our frontend (HTML, CSS, and JS) interacts with the backend (Flask). The pharma products are served from a JSON file, and the cart functionality is implemented by communicating with the backend via JavaScript fetch API.
