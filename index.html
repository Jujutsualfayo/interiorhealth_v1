        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>This project was inspired by my passion for solving real-world problems through technology. It started as a simple idea during a hackathon event, and after months of collaboration and learning, it evolved into what you see today. This is also a Portfolio Project for <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com">Holberton School</a>, showcasing our ability to create full-stack web applications.</p>
        <p>The project began in January 2024 and was completed by March 2024. Throughout this time, we encountered numerous challenges, but the process helped us grow as developers and problem solvers.</p>
